Yl PAY by Yuri 
 
 YL PAY aims to enable and facilitate charges via credit card within its system. Through an intelligent and integrated system with multiple payment gateways, your billing will be carried out with greater security. In the event of a failed billing attempt at a given gateway, a new billing attempt is made at the next gateway, until the operation is successful. Full Checkout In our complete checkout solution, we offer a responsive checkout screen that is already integrated with our API. Just import it into your project and follow the documentation to make the necessary settings to start using it. Core Checkout The "Core" solution makes it possible to maintain the visual identity of your application. The user will be free to implement their own checkout screen and then use the "Core" solution to integrate with the YL PAY APIs.
